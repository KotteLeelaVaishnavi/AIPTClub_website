AIPT is the official AI club of Vignan’s Institute of Engineering for Women, founded in 2023 and guided by Mrs. Y. Vineela Sravya. What began with six passionate students has now grown into a strong 10-member team dedicated to exploring and promoting Artificial Intelligence.

We organize workshops, guest lectures, hackathons like HackHers, ideathons like AI Genesis, and sessions like AI Connect, all designed to give students hands-on experience with AI tools, innovation, and teamwork.

Our vision is simple: to make AIPT a hub for AI learners—helping students turn ideas into impactful projects and become true pioneers of tomorrow.
